        <p style="text-align: justify; width: 1000px; padding-top: 20px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 17px;">
          Welcome to the future, where learning is making profit. Welcome to a world where education is based on decentralization and where every learner feels part of an enthusiastic global community. 
          Welcome to an online revolutionary ecosystem where individuals share their knowledge, apprehend futuristic technologies and employ them to create amazing projects.
          Unfortunately, we are not yet in the future and this ideal educational environment is not currently available. 
          Going back to the present, the global e-learning market is worth a total of 180 billion dollars. 
          This number is expected to double by 2025, as a consequence of the increasing demand for online courses and institutions. 
          Despite these promising statistics and the positive trend of the education sector, today’s e-learning platforms are characterized by the presence of several weak points yet to be addressed. 
          These weaknesses include:
       </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: square;  margin: 0 auto; font-size: 17px; width: 1000px; padding-top: 25px;">
            <li>Unqualified instructors</li>
            <li>Poor incentives and insufficient student motivation</li>
            <li>Lack of social presence</li>
            <li>Poor guidance in the learning process</li>
            <li>Vulnerability to cyber attacks</li>
            <li>Easy stealing of intellectual property</li>
          </ul>
       <p style="text-align: justify; width: 1000px; padding-top: 25px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 17px;">
          As a consequence of these inefficiencies,  there is a high loss of value which is ultimately passed onto users. The resulting state of affairs is not ideal for the future growth and development of the online education and project-development industry.

          Makerland’s online ecosystem represents the shift from today’s limited e-learning and project-building platforms to the open and flexible environments of tomorrow.
          Makerland is the first e-learning ecosystem and knowledge-based social network built on the blockchain decentralized technology and tokenization. 
          Makerland’s goal is to create a fully engaging e-learning environment and to truly spread the benefits online education across society, by designing a social, incentivized and student-constructed learning platform. 
          Moreover, for what concerns the weak points of today’s e-learning websites, Makerland seeks to resolve them through the adoption of blockchain technology, the collaboration with businesses and universities, the creation of an interactive social network and the employment of artificial intelligence. 
          Makerland also aims to offer an environment where users are able to build and develop their coding-related ideas, coming from their motivations and learning experiences on the platform.

        <h3 style="width: 1000px; padding-top: 80px; margin: 0 auto;">MARKET ANALYSIS: E-LEARNING AND MOOCs</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify; width: 1000px; padding-top: 10px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 17px;">
          The digital world has brought a lot of innovations to all businesses across the globe. Technological development has significantly affected the education sector, especially in the last few years. Today, it is almost undoubtable that the future of education lies in embracing e-learning and online resources. 
          In 2017, the global e-learning market was worth a total of 160 billion dollars [1]. By 2025, its size is expected to double and to reach USD 325 billion [2]. Currently, in 2020, the worldwide e-learning market has a value of approximately 205 billion dollars. A key factor driving the exponential growth of the market is certainly the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of online education. E-learning enables people to study from home, which improves convenience and eliminates the need to spend on accommodation and transportation. 
          An article on Forbes [3] notes that traditional educational institutions will struggle with the current curriculum and training programs in the coming years. In fact, roughly half of the subject knowledge acquired during the first year of a four-year technical degree will likely be outdated  by graduation. 
          According to Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor, half of all traditional colleges won’t exist in 10 years because online education will undermine their business models [4]. 
          Unsurprisingly, in a world where change is constant, there is a perpetual need to learn new skills, acquire knowledge and gain qualifications that are relevant in today's technologically driven marketplace. In a thriving digital economy, the demand for professionals with both technical and analytical skills is stimulating job creation and generating competition amongst employers looking to secure valuable talent [5]. In this world, online education represents the key to success. Courses on the web are cheaper and constantly kept up to date. In this way, students can view changes anytime and anywhere. Online education can act as nutrition for curious or talented minds, serve as support for students attending traditional institutions and completely replace some curricular programmes.  
          Nowadays, the largest and most valuable slice of the e-learning market is represented by platforms offering MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), which are online courses that are open to an unlimited number of students. Especially in the last few years, websites providing MOOCs have boomed and generated large communities of individuals willing to learn online. Compared to courses with a limited number of participants, MOOCs guarantee a significantly greater source of income. Therefore, they are vital for the growth, advancement and sustainability of the e-learning sector. Moreover, they contribute to making online education become more affordable, more enjoyable and more accessible. The following analysis takes into account the most popular and profitable MOOC platforms of 2019.

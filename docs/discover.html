          Welcome to the future, where learning is making profit. Welcome to a world where education is based on decentralization and where every learner feels part of an enthusiastic global community. 
          Welcome to an online revolutionary ecosystem where individuals share their knowledge, apprehend futuristic technologies and employ them to create amazing projects.
          Unfortunately, we are not yet in the future and this ideal educational environment is not currently available. 
          Going back to the present, the global e-learning market is worth a total of 180 billion dollars. 
          This number is expected to double by 2025, as a consequence of the increasing demand for online courses and institutions. 
          Despite these promising statistics and the positive trend of the education sector, today’s e-learning platforms are characterized by the presence of several weak points yet to be addressed. 
          These weaknesses include:
       </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: square;  margin: 0 auto; font-size: 17px; width: 1000px; padding-top: 25px;">
            <li>Unqualified instructors</li>
            <li>Poor incentives and insufficient student motivation</li>
            <li>Lack of social presence</li>
            <li>Poor guidance in the learning process</li>
            <li>Vulnerability to cyber attacks</li>
            <li>Easy stealing of intellectual property</li>
          </ul>
       <p style="text-align: justify; width: 1000px; padding-top: 20px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 17px;">
          As a consequence of these inefficiencies,  there is a high loss of value which is ultimately passed onto users. The resulting state of affairs is not ideal for the future growth and development of the online education and project-development industry.

          Makerland’s online ecosystem represents the shift from today’s limited e-learning and project-building platforms to the open and flexible environments of tomorrow.
          Makerland is the first e-learning ecosystem and knowledge-based social network built on the blockchain decentralized technology and tokenization. 
          Makerland’s goal is to create a fully engaging e-learning environment and to truly spread the benefits online education across society, by designing a social, incentivized and student-constructed learning platform. 
          Moreover, for what concerns the weak points of today’s e-learning websites, Makerland seeks to resolve them through the adoption of blockchain technology, the collaboration with businesses and universities, the creation of an interactive social network and the employment of artificial intelligence. 
          Makerland also aims to offer an environment where users are able to build and develop their coding-related ideas, coming from their motivations and learning experiences on the platform.

          Over the last few decades an immensive growth has been recorded in the projects that have been developed through crowdfunding campaigns. 
          In addition to this, promising ideas are currently leading to a competition among investors to look for the best available talent.
          In such a scenario, it is imperative to link the most appropriate investors and creators in a secure and cost optimal way. 
          To achieve this, we propose a global and decentralized crowdfunding platform based on the blockchain technology and tokenization.
          Blockchain technology helps in creating a decentralized and incentivized network of users where the transactions are recorded in an open distributed ledger. 
          These features of blockchain enable a transparent and cost-effective platform. 
          Moreover, smart contracts are also deployed between the investors and the creators in order to share project earnings and rewards. 
          All transactions and crowdfundings on the platform are carried out by employing the ecosystem's native token, called MAKERLAND (MKL).
